- #### Ammeter:

  - Ammeters are designed with the zero point in the center of the face and a negative or positive indication on either side [**Figure 2**]
  - An ammeter is used to monitor the performance of the aircraft electrical system which shows if the alternator/generator is producing an adequate supply of electrical power
  - When the pointer of the ammeter is on the plus side, it shows the charging rate of the battery
  - A minus indication means more current is being drawn from the battery than is being replaced
  - A full-scale minus deflection indicates a malfunction of the alternator/generator
  - A full-scale positive deflection indicates a malfunction of the regulator
    - In either case, consult the AFM or POH for appropriate action to be taken
  - Not all aircraft are equipped with an ammeter-some have a warning light that, when lighted, indicates a discharge in the system as a generator/alternator malfunction
    - Refer to the AFM or POH for appropriate action to be taken
  - It also indicates whether or not the battery is receiving an electrical charge

- #### Loadmeter:

  - The loadmeter reflects the total percentage of the load placed on the generating capacity of the electrical system by the electrical accessories and battery [**Figure 2**]
  - When all electrical components are turned off, it reflects only the amount of charging current demanded by the battery
