<h1>Impression of <em>Wuthering Heights</em></h1>

<h4>Written by Eric Zeng</h4>

<h2>Summary — Love and hatred, get and lose.</h2>

<p><em>Wuthering Height </em>is a 19th British literature work which explains a miserable love tale written by <em>Emily Bronte</em>. </p>

<p>Heathcliff, the hero of the story, adopted by the host of Wuthering Height called Mr. Earnshaw. When other members disliked and avoided Heathcliff, only Catherine Earnshaw who is Mr. Earnshaw’s daughter would like to play with him. As time goes on, they fell in love with each other. But after Mr. Earnshaw’s death, Catherine’s elder brother, Hindley Earnshaw prohibited Heathcliff for revenge and put him into servant. Because of hurt by a dog while playing with Heathcliff secretly, she was taken good care in Hwamei Height for five weeks, Edgar Linton’s manor. Linton soon attracted by her.The artless and childish Catherine accepted the propose of Linton’s marriage.Study of Heathcliff married Catherine knew the news, the excruciating, angrily left.</p>

<p>Many years after Heathcliff had his own business, Hindley became a alcoholic gambler.In order to repay his debt, he sold the Height and Heathcliff was the buyer. Heathcliff often went to Hwamei Height for his business, also for the person he had deep love. Having seen how hypocritical her husband was since got married, she was regretful and desperate. Linton’s sister Isabella gradually became fond of Heathcliff and finally she eloped with him. But when Isabella arrived at Wuthering Height. She was in imprisoned and in torment. Heathcliff gave vent to his discontent and indignation.</p>

<p>Catherine lost her life in desperate when delivered her and Linton’s child, Cathy. And Hindley was dead because of alcoholism. His son Hareton Earnshaw live in the Height as servant. Isabella escaped and give birth to her son called Isabella Linton, whose father was Heathcliff. No sooner had Isabella dead than Heathcliff brought back his son. It was strange that Heathcliff was so disgusted about his son but still lived with.</p>

<p>In spite of Hareton living in a such dark circumstance, he became a forthright and sincerely man, who Cathy soon fell in love with, that made Heathcliff so annoyed.But their love reminded Heathcliff of the time he lived with Catherine, reviving the love in Heathcliff’s deepest heart. His hatred faded away, and died in a wuthering rainstorm.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth.”</em>—Chapter 34</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Marriage — Selfish or Generous.</h2>

<p>When Catherine thought about whether she would accept Linton or live with Heathcliff. She said:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“ if Heathcliff and I married, we should be beggars? whereas, if I marry Linton I can aid Heathcliff to rise, and place him out of my brother&#39;s power.”</em>—Catherine.</p>

<p><em>“I think that&#39;s the worst motive you&#39;ve given yet for being the wife of young Linton.”</em>—Ellen, Catherine’s maid, Chapter 9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Maybe Catherine’s word is true because in the future time she also show her love to Heathcliff. But if Heathcliff was still a beggar or servant instead of a business man, will she love him anymore? In my opinion, Catherine’s decision was a bit selfish. In her imagination, she thought not only Heathcliff would raised his statue, but also lived in a comfortable live. It is truth that this hurt Heathcliff deeply, also the reason of his revenge.</p>

<h2>Love — Concise or twisty.</h2>

<p>There is no doubt that Catherine’s true love is Heathcliff. But their love is so twisty. For instance, Heathcliff was in prejudice because he was a beggar. Though they loved each other, their family denied. Heathcliff got married with Linton’s sister, for revenge. Affection is just a pure and concise thing that only need couple’s true love is all. If mixed with too much impurity, love will gradually become a pressure, even an evil. </p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>“My love for Linton is like the foliage in the woods: time will change it, I&#39;m well aware, as winter changes the trees. My love for Heathcliff resembles the eternal rocks beneath: a source of little visible delight, but necessary.”</em>—Catherine, Chapter 9</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the end of the story Hareton and Cathy were playing in the front field of Wuthering Height, like Heathcliff and Catherine in past. Hope they could love each other forever with a pure heart.</p>

<h2>Artistic Method in novel.</h2>

<p>At the beginning of the story, the author use a flashback, that Lockwood rent for the Hwamei Height. It makes me confused that I don’t know what this novel talking about. It is a typical character of novel in 19th British literature, to show the reader the climax of the story. It also used in films, like <em>Schindler&#39;s List</em>, <em>Titanic</em> etc.</p>

<p>It told us a revenge story, which is not rare in British literature.<em>Hamlet</em> (Shakespeare) is a typical example. But its unique way of Heathcliff’s revenge appeals to everyone. Instead of the pain in physical body, Heathcliff torture and destroy mentally in no mercy, which is surprising me a lot. I think it is why MS Maugham (English Writer) said this book is <em>“one of the most carefully constructed novels in English.”</em><em>(See more in Appendix II)</em></p>

<h2>My thought — Wuthering Height, wuthers my mind.</h2>

<p>Wuthering Height, as it was called, whether the fierce wind in raining, the spring-love breeze, or the bise of Heathcliff’s revenge. Heathcliff killed the chick which was given birth to him and Catherine. Also, he killed the beauty in his life. Only for Catherine for alive, is morbidly. At the beginning of each love story is glorious with great happiness, but as time goes by, it gradually change after having experienced more and more hardship, more steady, or fragile. </p>

<p>Time will selected the right person for you in the right time. Even if separated for many years, meet again, will embrace.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>”Can you promise you never leave me away” </em>— Heathcliff<em>
</em></p>

<p><em>”I promise.”</em>—Catherine, Chapter 7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Story ended, but two people in another world in the continuation, has just begun.</p>
