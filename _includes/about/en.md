Hi, I am *@eric5013* Eric Zeng.(Jianpeng), a 00s full stack developer who gonna be scheduled to practice flying abroad assigned by China Southern Airline company.

Previously, at the time I got my first PC (family share together) made by Lenovo, which `command line (DOS)` was installed. There was the start of story, after getting aquaintant with`C/C#` `Visual Basic` `Yi Language(易语言)`on Windows XP, `HTML` `Javascript` `CSS` `Java`on Windows 7, then `PHP` `jQuery` `Electron` `AngularJS` `Vue.js` etc. Mountainuous frameworks and plugins on my personal MacBook.
